* Read Learn CSS Layout

* Starting with example 3/19, re-create each example as you read in its own html page.

* Your first example should be in an index.html file in the project directory.

* Each subsequent example should be in a different html file named something like example2.html, etc. **Make sure ALL your html files are in one directory.**

* From each file, include a link to the next example (this is a departure from the examples as they exist in the tutorial). At the last example, include a link back to the beginning.

* You only need **ONE** css file for **ALL** the html files. They can share! Make your styles as they are in the examples.

* Use filler text like _ipsum_ when necessary

* Create a git repository in your project directory and push it to Github.
